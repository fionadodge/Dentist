        <h2>Dental emergency and out-of-hours care</h2>
        <p>If you think you need urgent care, contact your usual dentist as some surgeries offer emergency dental slots and will provide care if clinically necessary.

            You can also contact NHS 111, who can put you in touch with an urgent dental service.
            
            Do not contact a GP, as they will not be able to offer urgent or emergency dental care.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>When to go to A&E</h2>
        <p> Only visit A&E in serious circumstances, such as:
        <p>* severe pain</p>
        <p>* heavy bleeding</p>
        <p>* injuries to the face, mouth or teeth</p>
        <p>If you're not sure whether you should go to A&E, contact NHS 111, who will be able to advise you.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>How much will I be charged</h2>
        <p>The emergency dentist will only deal with the problem at hand and provide clinically necessary treatment to stop any pain.

            An urgent dental treatment will be charged at Band 1 (Â£23.80), unless you're entitled to free NHS dental treatment.
            
            If you're asked to come back for further treatment, this will be considered a separate course of non-urgent treatment.
            
            If you're not entitled to free NHS dental treatment, you'll have to pay the relevant charge for the new course of treatment.
            
            Ask the dentist what the treatment will cost or whether you can have a treatment plan.</p>
